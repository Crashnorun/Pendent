Hi,
I'm working on a design for a piece of jewelry that I was thinking of laser cutting. The final piece would be of stainless steel, but there would be a couple of prototypes out of acrylic. The overall dimensions are 3" x 1 1/16". I'm envisioning the material to be 1/8" thick. I've attached a photo of what I'm thinking. As you'll notice the piece varies in width, One of the narrowest parts is 7/64"
Let me know your thoughts on feasibility. 
Cheers,
